## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash

### 2. Setup Authentication

**Method 1: Environment Variables (Recommended)**

**Option A: Create .env file**
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your credentials
```

**Option B: Export environment variables**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
export APPLE_ID="your_apple_id@example.com"
export APPLE_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Windows
set APPLE_ID=your_apple_id@example.com
set APPLE_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Method 2: Interactive Input**
If environment variables are not set, the program will securely prompt for credentials.

### 3. Run the Program
```bash
uv run python main.py
```
